For the to do list app ==

1 - Create the template to have every task fitted in
2 - Figure out how to make the user input Hours and Dates (Maybe Search how to implement a calendar-based input for date)
3 - Put a bar on the top of the to do list app for the user to select between (completed tasks, current tasks, archived tasks)
4 - Filter every Task by (is_completed) so I know what goes in (completed tasks) or (current_tasks)
